Character-Level LLM Project: Full Workflow Plan

=================================================
Stage 1: Setup & Data Preparation
=================================================
Goal: Build a clean input pipeline using text8.
Steps:
1. Download and preprocess text8 dataset.
2. Normalize characters (a-z, space).
3. Encode text into integer tokens.
4. Split into train/valid/test sets (e.g., 90/5/5%).
5. Create DataLoader using sliding windows of context length L.

=================================================
Stage 2: Baseline Model Implementation
=================================================
Goal: Run a minimal working Transformer or LSTM model.
Steps:
1. Implement Transformer architecture.
2. Define hyperparameters (L, d_model, n_heads, etc.).
3. Test forward pass and confirm loss decreases.
4. Verify model generates text (even if gibberish).

=================================================
Stage 3: Small-Scale Experiments
=================================================
Goal: Explore model design and training choices at small scale.
Experiment Dimensions:
- Model: n_layers, n_heads, d_model, ff_dim, dropout, positional encoding.
- Context length (L): {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}.
- Loss: Cross-entropy, label smoothing.
- Optimization: AdamW vs Adam vs SGD.
- Regularization: dropout, weight decay.
Metrics:
- Validation loss, accuracy, bits-per-character (BPC), GPU usage.
Tools: TensorBoard or WandB for logging.

=================================================
Stage 4: Scaling Up & Refinement
=================================================
Goal: Stress-test the best small-scale design on larger configs.
Steps:
1. Increase model size moderately (e.g., L=256, d_model=384).
2. Fine-tune batch size, LR, optimizer settings.
3. Add gradient clipping, mixed precision if needed.
4. Monitor GPU memory and training stability.
Outcome: Stable, scalable configuration ready for long run.

=================================================
Stage 5: Final Training & Evaluation
=================================================
Goal: Commit to final config and train to convergence.
Steps:
1. Lock hyperparameters.
2. Train for several hours or until validation loss plateaus.
3. Save checkpoints and logs.
4. Evaluate on test set (loss, accuracy, BPC, perplexity).
5. Generate qualitative samples with different temperatures.
Output: Final model + evaluation results.

=================================================
Stage 6: Report Writing
=================================================
Goal: Document your full experimental process.
Outline:
1. Introduction – motivation & dataset.
2. Model Description – architecture overview.
3. Experiments & Tuning – results & analysis.
4. Discussion – key insights, trade-offs.
5. Conclusion – summary & possible future directions.
Evaluation Weights: 70% exploration, 20% report, 10% code quality.
